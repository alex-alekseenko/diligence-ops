  “ We’re continuously inspired by the imaginative                                                                   


  Message from our         

To our shareholders,

This has been an exceptional year at Apple.
We are so excited about all the ways we are sharing our products, pushing the limits of what’s possible, and making technology
that empowers people and enriches their lives.

This is an ideal moment to reflect on where
we are today, and in that spirit, I’d invite you to join us for the 2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on February 24,
2026, where we’ll celebrate all we’ve accomplished over the past year.

Our latest iPhone lineup features the
most powerful iPhone we’ve ever made with iPhone 17 Pro, and the thinnest iPhone we’ve ever made with iPhone Air.
Along with iPhone 17, our entire lineup features incredibly advanced camera systems, powerful performance, and all-day battery
life our users love.

Our technology has never done more to help our users stay productive, connected, and healthy. With the M5-powered iPad Pro, MacBook Pro, and Vision Pro, and across our product lineups, Apple silicon continues to deliver unmatched power and performance
to help our users get more done. This year, we also introduced a beautiful new design called Liquid Glass, which creates a
unified experience across our platforms for the very first time. And I hear from Apple users every day who credit our health
and safety features with improving their lives, or even saving them.

AirPods Pro 3 have been another huge hit,
delivering remarkable sound quality and the world’s best in-ear active noise cancellation. And with Live Translation powered
by Apple Intelligence, AirPods unlock a whole new way to connect and communicate with people across languages and around the world.

It’s a powerful example of the incredible
possibilities we’re unlocking with AI, which we see as one of the most profound technologies of our lifetime. That’s
why, from the silicon to the software, we’re building our products from the ground up to enable powerful AI experiences.
With Apple Intelligence, we’re delivering on a hallmark of Apple products by making complex technologies easy and accessible
for our customers. And we now have dozens of Apple Intelligence features - like Writing Tools and Visual Intelligence - 
that are empowering our users in remarkable ways.

We’ve also continued to deliver world-class Services - including Apple Music, Apple Pay, and the App Store - that give our users even more ways to learn, create, and connect. For instance, Apple TV originals continue to earn praise
from fans and critics alike - including clever comedies like “ The Studio,” riveting dramas like “ Severance”
and “ Pluribus,” and thrilling, cinematic hits like “ F1.”

As always, we’ve continued to build
our values into everything we do - from our commitment to protecting people’s privacy and security, to designing our
products to be accessible to all. Around the world, we’re giving students and teachers the tools to learn new skills and
harness their creativity.

And we’re continuously inspired by
the imaginative ways people are using our technology to build new businesses, create beautiful art, and serve their communities.

On behalf of everyone at Apple, thank you
for your engagement, your confidence, and your belief in our mission. We’ve accomplished so much together - and I’ve
never been more optimistic about the future.

Tim Cook

Progress Across our Values

At Apple, we lead with our values in the
technology we make, the way we make it, and how we treat people and the planet we all share.

We believe the best technology should work
for everyone, so we build accessibility into all our products from the ground up. That’s led to many profound innovations
helping our users navigate, communicate, and engage with the world around them. And we’ve continued to drive innovations
that help our users live healthier lives, including new features like sleep score and hypertension notifications.

We also believe privacy is a fundamental
human right, and we continue to design our products to protect it from the start. That includes Private Cloud Compute for Apple
Intelligence, which extends our on-device security model into the cloud. And it includes tools and resources that empower parents
and help kids stay safe online without compromising their privacy.

Our values also shape our impact on the
communities we’re a part of. We work to expand access to education and opportunity with programs like the Apple Developer
Academies, which help learners build new skills and prepare for promising careers. We continue to innovate to reduce the environmental
impact of our devices - including a new 3D-printing process for the titanium cases of Apple Watch that uses 100 percent
recycled materials. And we work to foster a culture of collaboration and belonging, where teams come together to innovate and
do the best work of their lives.

From the technology we make, to the communities
we serve, teams at Apple are dedicated to leaving the world better than we found it and making a positive difference in people’s
lives.

Role of the Board of Directors

Apple’s Board oversees the CEO and other
senior management in the competent and ethical operation of Apple and seeks to ensure that the long-term interests of shareholders
are being served. Directors are expected to take a proactive, focused approach to ensure Apple is committed to business success
through the maintenance of high standards of responsibility and ethics.

Board Independence

Apple’s Corporate Governance Guidelines
require a majority of Board members to be independent. The Board has determined that all Board members, other than Mr. Cook, are
independent under applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“ Nasdaq”).

Apple’s Board has a standing Audit
and Finance Committee (the “ Audit Committee”), People and Compensation Committee (the “ People and
Compensation Committee”), and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the “ Nominating Committee”).
The Board has determined that all committee members are independent under applicable Nasdaq and Securities and Exchange
Commission (“ SEC”) rules for committee memberships, and that each member of the Audit Committee also meets the
additional independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“ Exchange Act”).

Board and Committee Structure

Apple regularly reviews the Board’s leadership
structure and the responsibilities and composition of its standing committees. The structure and composition of Apple’s Board
and its committees are intended to leverage the wide range of perspectives of the Board members and promote effective oversight.

The Board believes its current leadership
structure, in which the roles of Chair and CEO are separated, best serves Apple’s overall corporate structure and the
Board’s ability to carry out its roles and responsibilities on behalf of Apple’s shareholders, including its
oversight of management and corporate governance matters. The Board also believes that the current structure allows our CEO
to focus on managing Apple, while leveraging our independent Chair’s experience to drive accountability at the Board
level.

The current membership and function of each
standing committee is described on the following page. Each committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which
is available at investor. apple. com/leadership-and-governance. Each committee reviews and assesses its charter annually.

Board Meetings and Attendance

The
Board met four times during 2025. Each member of the Board who served during 2025 attended or participated in 75% or more
of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board held during 2025, and (ii) the total number of meetings
held by each committee of the Board on which the member served during 2025.

Apple
expects all of its directors to attend the Annual Meeting. All directors attended the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders (the
“2025 Annual Meeting”).

Annual Board and Committee Self-Evaluations

The
Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to assess whether the Board, its committees, and each member of the Board are working
effectively, and to provide an opportunity to reflect upon and improve processes and effectiveness.

The
Nominating Committee designs and establishes the overall evaluation framework, and Dr. Levinson, the independent Chair of
the Board, leads the evaluation interviews and feedback sessions. Dr. Levinson conducts one-on-one discussions with each
director to obtain their assessment of the effectiveness and performance of the Board and its committees. Additional
discussion topics include Board and committee composition and refreshment; timing, agendas, and content of Board and
committee meetings; Board dynamics and function; peer reviews of other members; and the Board’s oversight of executive
succession planning. Board members are also invited to discuss the performance of Dr. Levinson directly with the Chair of the
Nominating Committee. A summary identifying any themes or issues that have emerged is presented to the Board on an anonymous
basis.

Each
committee conducts its own annual self-evaluation and reports the results to the Board. Each committee’s evaluation includes
an assessment of the committee’s compliance with Apple’s Corporate Governance Guidelines and the committee’s
charter.

Related Party Policy and Transactions

The Board has adopted a written policy for
approval of transactions between Apple and its directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater than 5% beneficial
owners of Apple’s common stock or any other class of Apple’s equity securities, and each of their respective
immediate family members, where the amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed $120,000
in a single fiscal year and the related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest in the transaction (other than
solely as a result of being a director or less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A copy of this policy is
available at investor. apple. com/leadership-and-governance. The policy provides that the
Audit Committee must review transactions subject to the policy and determine whether to approve or ratify those transactions.
Certain types of transactions are deemed pre-approved pursuant to standing pre-approval guidelines established by the Audit
Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee has delegated authority to its Chair to pre-approve or ratify transactions under
certain circumstances. A summary of new transactions covered by standing pre-approvals or transactions approved or ratified
by the Chair of the Audit Committee, if any, is provided to the Audit Committee for its review.

In reviewing transactions subject to the policy,
the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Audit Committee, as applicable, considers (as it deems appropriate for the circumstances):

  The nature and extent of the related person’s interest                                                                     
  The approximate dollar value involved in the transaction;

Several of Apple’s Board members and executive
officers serve as directors or executive officers of other organizations, including organizations with which Apple has commercial
and charitable relationships. Apple does not believe that any director had a direct or indirect material interest in any such relationships
during 2025 and through the date of this Proxy Statement.

A family member of our former Chief Operating
Officer is employed by Apple and received total compensation in excess of $120,000 for the period from the beginning of fiscal
year 2025 through the date of the filing of this Proxy Statement. The family member’s compensation was established by Apple
in accordance with our compensation practices applicable to employees with comparable qualifications and responsibilities and holding
similar positions.

Business Conduct Policy

Apple seeks to conduct business ethically, honestly,
and in compliance with applicable laws. Apple’s code of ethics, entitled “ Business Conduct: The way we do business,”
sets out the principles that guide Apple’s business practices - honesty, respect, confidentiality, and compliance.
The code applies to all employees, including Apple’s principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal
accounting officer. Relevant sections of the code also apply to the Board. Apple expects its suppliers, contractors, consultants,
and other business partners to follow the principles set forth in the code when providing goods and services to Apple or acting
on its behalf. The code is available at apple. com/compliance/pdfs/Business-Conduct-Policy. pdf.
Apple intends to disclose any changes to or waivers from this code by posting to our website if disclosure is required by SEC or
Nasdaq rules.

Apple’s code is managed by the Business
Conduct organization, under the oversight of Apple’s Chief Compliance Officer. Employees are required to complete training
on the code upon joining Apple and annually thereafter. With input from relevant stakeholders and executive leadership, we regularly
review and update Apple’s code and related policies to ensure they provide clear, actionable guidance to our employees, executive
officers, and directors.

Additionally, Apple has an insider trading policygoverning the purchase, sale, and other dispositions of Apple’s securities that applies to all Apple personnel, including
directors, officers, employees, and other covered persons. Apple also follows procedures for the repurchase of its securities.
We believe our insider trading policy and repurchase procedures are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading
laws, rules and regulations, and listing standards applicable to Apple. A copy of Apple’s insider trading policy was filed
as Exhibit 19.1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 28, 2024.

Communications with the Board

Any matter intended for the Board, or for any
individual member of the Board, should be directed to Apple’s Secretary at One Apple Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA
95014 USA, with a request to forward the communication to the intended recipient. In general, any shareholder communication delivered
to Apple for forwarding to Board members will be forwarded in accordance with the shareholder’s instructions. Apple reserves
the right to not forward to Board members any abusive, threatening, or otherwise inappropriate materials.

Board Composition and Evaluation of Candidates

Board Composition

Apple’s Board consists of a highly qualified
group of leaders from a broad range of fields and backgrounds. All of our directors have senior leadership experience at large
domestic or multinational companies. In these positions, they have gained significant and varied management experience, including
in the areas of strategic and financial planning, public company financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership
development. They also have in-depth experience serving at public companies as executive officers, or on boards of directors and
board committees, and a robust understanding of corporate governance practices and trends. In addition, many of our directors have
experience as directors or trustees of significant public policy, academic, research, non-profit, and philanthropic institutions,
and bring the benefit of these perspectives to the Board.

The Board and the Nominating Committee believe
the skills and experiences of our directors provide Apple with business acumen and a broad range of perspectives to effectively
address Apple’s evolving needs, oversee senior management in the competent and ethical operation of Apple, and represent
the best interests of Apple’s shareholders.

Evaluation of Candidates

The Board regularly evaluates its composition in the context of Apple’s long-term strategic goals. When considering
candidates for election, the Board assesses each nominee’s skills, backgrounds, experiences, and contributions in light
of the Board’s and the Company’s evolving needs. Over the past four years, the Board has added three new members,
representing over one-third of its membership, and two other, long-serving members retired. In the context of this year’s
Annual Meeting nominations, the Board determined that it would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders to ask
Art Levinson, the Chair of the Board, and Ron Sugar, the Chair of the Audit Committee, to stand for re-election, and to waive
for each of them its guideline under which directors generally may not stand for re-election after attaining age 75. In making
this determination, the Board considered several factors, including the significant experience and expertise that each of
Dr. Levinson and Dr. Sugar brings to the Board, their deep insight into the Company’s business and operations, and their
individual contributions as highly engaged members of the Board. The Board also considered the benefits of continuity among
the Board’s leadership positions.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require an annual review by the Nominating Committee of each director’s various
time commitments, including their primary occupation, service on other public company boards and board committees, leadership
positions on other boards, as well as service with private company boards and non-profit organizations. Following its review
in November 2025, the Nominating Committee determined that, in its view, no director currently has time commitments that would
prevent them from properly discharging their duties as directors.

The Nominating Committee has evaluated and recommended to the full Board each of the nominees named in this Proxy Statement
for election to the Board.

Nominee Selection Process

The Nominating Committee oversees board succession
planning and recruitment of potential candidates. The Nominating Committee considers candidates who are recommended by the Committee’s
members, other Board members, shareholders, and management, as well as those identified by third-party search firms retained to
assist in identifying and evaluating possible candidates. In evaluating potential nominees to the Board, the Nominating Committee
considers, among other things: independence, character, ability to exercise sound judgment, demonstrated leadership, ability and
willingness to commit sufficient time to the Board, and relevant skills, backgrounds, and experiences in the context of the evolving
needs and overall composition of the Board. The Nominating Committee is committed to including individuals with a broad range of
skills, backgrounds, and experiences in the pool of candidates from which nominees to the Board are selected.

The Nominating Committee evaluates candidates
recommended by shareholders using the same criteria it applies to evaluate other candidates. Shareholders who wish to recommend
a director candidate should submit the candidate’s name and background information in writing to our Secretary at One Apple
Park Way, MS: 927-4GC, Cupertino, CA 95014 USA. In addition, the proxy access provisions in our bylaws provide that a shareholder,
or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding shares continuously for at least three years, may nominate
director nominees constituting up to 20% of Apple’s Board for inclusion in our proxy statement. Nominating shareholders and
nominees must satisfy the requirements set forth in our bylaws, which can be found at investor. apple. com/leadership-and-governance.
Any notice of director nomination submitted to Apple other than through proxy access must include the additional information required
by Rule 14a-19(b) under the Exchange Act.

Nominees for Election

The matrix on the following page highlights
the mix of key skills and experiences of the nominees that, among other factors, led the Board and the Nominating Committee to
recommend these nominees for election to the Board. The matrix is intended to depict notable areas of focus for each director based
on the current composition of the Board, and not having a mark does not mean that a particular director does not possess that qualification
or skill. Nominees have developed competencies in these skills through education, direct experience, and oversight responsibilities.
The Nominating Committee assesses the directors’ mix of skills on an annual basis. Additional biographical information on each
nominee is set out starting on page 27.

Compensation of Directors

Members of the Board who are not Apple employees
(“ Non-Employee Directors”) receive compensation for their service on the Board. As an Apple employee, Mr. Cook, our
CEO, does not receive compensation for his service on the Board. The People and Compensation Committee annually reviews the total
compensation of our Non-Employee Directors and each element of our Non-Employee Director compensation program. As part of this
process, the People and Compensation Committee evaluates market data provided by its independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance
LLC (“ Pay Governance”), and makes a recommendation to the Board. The Board determines the form and amount of Non-Employee
Director compensation after reviewing the People and Compensation Committee’s recommendation. The Apple Inc. Non-Employee
Director Stock Plan (the “ Director Plan”) has an annual limit of $1.5 million for all compensation paid or granted
to a Non-Employee Director for service on the Board.

Cash Retainers

Our Non-Employee Directors receive an annual
cash retainer of $100,000. In 2025, the Chair of the Board, Dr. Levinson, received an additional cash retainer of $175,000; the
Chair of the Audit Committee, Dr. Sugar, received an additional cash retainer of $45,000; the Chair of the People and Compensation
Committee, Ms. Jung, received an additional cash retainer of $40,000; and the Chair of the Nominating Committee, Ms. Wagner, received
an additional cash retainer of $35,000. All retainers are paid in quarterly installments.

Equity-Based Awards

A substantial portion of each Non-Employee Director’s
annual retainer is in the form of equity awards. Under the Director Plan, Non-Employee Directors are granted restricted stock units
(“ RSUs”) on the date of each annual meeting of shareholders (each, an “ Annual Director Award”). All Annual
Director Awards vest on February 1 of the following year, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date. In
2025, the Director Plan was amended to increase the Annual Director Award value to $310,000. At Dr. Levinson’s request, the
Board maintained his Annual Director Award at $275,000. With the exception of Dr. Levinson, the number of RSUs underlying
each Annual Director Award for each Non-Employee Director in 2025 was 1,255, which was determined by dividing $310,000 by the per
share closing price of Apple’s common stock on the grant date, rounded to the nearest whole share. Dr. Levinson’s Annual
Director Award was determined by dividing $275,000 by the per share closing price of Apple’s common stock on the grant date,
rounded to the nearest whole share.

A Non-Employee Director who is newly appointed
to the Board other than in connection with an annual meeting of shareholders will receive a grant of RSUs upon appointment (an
“ Initial Director Award”), except that a Non-Employee Director who first joins the Board on or after February 1 of
a particular year and prior to the annual meeting for that year, or a director who was an employee of Apple immediately prior to
first becoming a Non-Employee Director, will not receive an Initial Director Award. The number of RSUs subject to each Initial
Director Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the award is pro-rated based
on the portion of the vesting period that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director Awards are scheduled to vest
on the next February 1 following the grant of the award, subject to continued service on the Board through the vesting date.

Each RSU award granted under the Director Plan
is credited with an amount equal to any ordinary dividend paid by Apple, multiplied by the total number of RSUs subject to the
award that are outstanding immediately prior to the record date for the dividend. The amounts credited to each RSU are referred
to as “dividend equivalents.” Any dividend equivalents credited to RSUs granted under the Director Plan are subject
to the same vesting, payment, and other terms and conditions as the RSUs to which the dividend equivalents relate. The dividend
equivalents are meant to treat the RSU award holders consistently with shareholders.

Equipment and Other Business-Related Programs

Apple has an equipment program for the Board
under which each Non-Employee Director is eligible to receive, upon request and free of charge, one of each new product introduced
by Apple, and is eligible to purchase additional equipment at a discount. Each Non-Employee Director is also eligible to participate
in Apple’s matching gifts program to the same extent as Apple employees.

Deferred Compensation Plan

We maintain the Apple Inc. Deferred Compensation
Plan (the “ Deferred Compensation Plan”), under which eligible participants, including our Non-Employee Directors, may
elect to defer a portion of their eligible compensation, subject to the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan. The Deferred Compensation
Plan is unfunded and unsecured. We do not provide any matching contributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan or allow for
deferral of RSUs. Ms. Lozano deferred a portion of her fees earned into the Deferred Compensation Plan in 2025.

Stock Ownership Guidelines

Apple has stock ownership guidelines for our
CEO, executive officers, and Non-Employee Directors. Under the guidelines, each Non-Employee Director is expected, within five
years after joining the Board, to own shares of Apple’s common stock that have a value equal to five times their annual cash
retainer for serving as a director. Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with, or separately by, the individual’s
spouse, or held in trust for the benefit of the individual, the individual’s spouse, or the individual’s children.
Other than Dr. Austin, who joined the Board in 2024, each Non-Employee Director currently owns shares of Apple’s common stock
that have a value at least equal to five times their annual cash retainer.

The compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2025 reflects
their contributions to Apple’s success and continues to demonstrate alignment with Apple’s strong financial results
and the interests of our shareholders. The vast majority of our named executive officers’ compensation is at-risk and delivered
through short-term cash incentives and long-term equity awards. The performance-based RSU awards that vested in 2025 reflect Apple’s
strong stock price performance for the period from the start of 2022 through the end of 2024. Apple’s total shareholder return
relative to other companies in the S& P 500 (“ Relative TSR”) was at the 81.20th percentile for this performance
period. As a result, in 2025, our named executive officers with performance-based RSUs granted in 2022 vested in 187% of the target
performance-based RSUs. We also reported net sales of $416.2 billion and operating income results of $133.1 billion for 2025, resulting
in a maximum payout for each of our named executive officers under the Apple Inc. Executive Cash Incentive Plan (the “ Cash
Incentive Plan”).

Say on Pay Advisory Vote Results

At the 2025 Annual Meeting, 92% of votes cast on the Say on Pay advisory
proposal were in favor of our executive compensation program, demonstrating significant shareholder support for the overall structure
of our executive compensation program and the compensation paid to our named executive officers for 2024. The People and Compensation
Committee considered this strong shareholder support and did not make any changes to the overall structure of our executive compensation
program and maintained Mr. Cook’s total target compensation between the 80th to 90th percentile range of target CEO pay at
our 2025 primary peer companies given our relative size, scope, and success.

Guiding Compensation Principles

Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate and reward
outstanding financial performance, retain talented, values-driven leaders, and promote teamwork in a straightforward and effective
way. Our clear guiding principles and sound compensation policies and practices align the pay of our named executive officers with
Company performance, taking into consideration the size, scope, and success of Apple’s business.

Team-Based Approach

We apply a unique team-based approach to the compensation of our
named executive officers to emphasize their shared responsibility for Apple’s overall success. This approach recognizes the
exceptional experience, leadership, and value each of our named executive officers contributes to Apple’s leadership team,
with CEO compensation awarded at a higher level to reflect the additional scope and complexity of that role.

Performance Expectations

The vast majority of our executive pay is tied to Apple’s financial
performance to ensure alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders. Each year, we establish clear, quantitative financial
goals for our named executive officers that are intended to drive Apple’s overall success.

Emphasis on Long-Term Equity Awards

We emphasize long-term performance, retention, and alignment between
the interests of our named executive officers and those of our shareholders by allocating a significant portion of our named executive
officers’ compensation to long-term equity awards. Performance-based RSUs reward long-term TSR out-performance relative to
other companies. Time-based RSUs are also an important component of long-term equity awards because they promote stability and
retention of our exceptional leadership team while vesting over a longer time frame of approximately 4.5 years.

Executive Compensation Decision-Making Process

Establishing appropriate compensation and incentive opportunities
for our named executive officers is a core responsibility of the People and Compensation Committee. The People and Compensation
Committee consists entirely of independent directors who review and approve the compensation and incentives of Apple’s named
executive officers each year. It also administers Apple’s employee stock plans. The People and Compensation Committee may
delegate its authority under its charter to Apple’s officers or employees, or any of its individual members, except to the
extent otherwise prohibited by SEC or Nasdaq rules, or other applicable laws. The People and Compensation Committee’s authority
to grant discretionary equity awards under our employee stock plans or to take any other action with respect to equity awards (other
than the performance of ministerial duties) may not be delegated to Apple’s management or others.

The Role of the Compensation Consultant

The People and Compensation Committee selects and retains the services
of its own independent compensation consultant and annually reviews the consultant’s performance. As part of the review process,
the People and Compensation Committee considers the independence of the consultant in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules.

During 2025, the People and Compensation Committee’s independent
compensation consultant, Pay Governance, provided no services to Apple other than services for the People and Compensation Committee
and worked with Apple’s management, as directed by the People and Compensation Committee, only on matters for which the People
and Compensation Committee is responsible. At the People and Compensation Committee’s request, Pay Governance regularly attends
the People and Compensation Committee meetings. Pay Governance also communicates with the members of the People and Compensation
Committee outside committee meetings regarding matters related to the People and Compensation Committee’s responsibilities.

In 2025, the People and Compensation Committee generally sought input
from Pay Governance on Apple’s compensation programs, including: external market factors; shareholder engagement; overall
compensation program design; evolving compensation trends; appropriate market reference points; and market compensation data. Pay
Governance also consulted with the People and Compensation Committee regarding the amount and form of compensation for our CEO
and other named executive officers.

Role of Peer Groups

The People and Compensation Committee reviews and approves the composition
of a primary peer group each year to serve as the market reference point for compensation opportunity comparison purposes, to inform
its decision-making process, and to set total target compensation levels that it believes are competitive and commensurate with
Apple’s relative size, scope, and success.

Apple remains significantly larger than most other companies with
$416.2 billion in revenue for 2025 and market capitalization of $3.8 trillion, as of the last trading day of 2025. This was approximately
seven times the market capitalization and five times the revenue of the median peer companies in our 2025 peer group, which were
$512.7 billion for market capitalization and $77.2 billion for revenue, respectively.

  Market Capitalization      Revenue  

  Market capitalization for our primary peers is the amount reported by Bloomberg L. P. as of September 26, 2025, the last trading day of 2025. Revenue is based on the trailing 12 months’ revenue...  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Our primary peer group consists of large U. S.-based, stand-alone,
publicly traded companies in the technology, media, and internet services industries that, in the People and Compensation Committee’s
view, compete with Apple for executive talent. Commensurate with Apple’s size and scope, the People and Compensation Committee
reviews Mr. Cook’s total target compensation against the annualized total target CEO pay of our primary peer group, focusing
on the 80th to 90th percentiles of peer CEO pay when setting Mr. Cook’s pay. Other than for Mr. Cook, the People and Compensation
Committee does not set compensation components for our named executive officers to meet specific benchmarks as compared to our
peer companies.

The threshold revenue and market capitalization requirements for
a company to be considered for the primary peer group for 2025 were $20 billion and $100 billion, respectively. The chart below
lists the companies in our 2025 primary peer group.

                             2025 Primary Peer Group                                              

For many years, a secondary peer group of companies was developed as an additional reference set to assess pay practices but
not to benchmark pay levels or structure. This secondary peer group was composed of companies that: have iconic brands or
are industry or category leaders, rely on significant research and development and innovation for growth, and require highly
skilled employees. For 2025, this group included AbbVie, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Nike, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble,
Starbucks, and UnitedHealth Group. While other points of reference may be considered from time to time, in 2025 the People
and Compensation Committee determined to eliminate consideration of a formal secondary peer group for 2026. The People and
Compensation Committee also determined a primary peer group solely focused on the technology and media sectors would provide
a more tailored source of competitive pay data and removed AT& T, Mastercard, Verizon, and Visa from the 2026 primary peer
group.

CEO Peer Pay Positioning

The People and Compensation Committee reviewed Mr. Cook’s performance
and the annualized total target compensation of CEOs in our primary peer group, and consulted with its independent compensation
consultant, prior to setting Mr. Cook’s 2025 total target compensation, which remains within the 80th to 90th percentile
range relative to the annualized target CEO pay of our primary peer group companies. Mr. Cook’s consistently exceptional
performance, Apple’s size and scope, and shareholder feedback support the positioning of Mr. Cook’s total target compensation
within this targeted range.

To determine Mr. Cook’s total target compensation relative
to other CEOs in our primary peer group, the People and Compensation Committee considered the annualized total target compensation
opportunity (which includes base salary, target cash incentive opportunities, and target value of equity awards) for CEOs at each
of the primary peer companies using publicly available filings. Any primary peer companies with CEOs that did not receive direct
incentive compensation were excluded from the analysis. In addition, long-term equity awards were annualized to account for variability
in granting practices. As a result, the values for total target compensation used in the analysis may differ from proxy reported
summary compensation table values, which reflect base salary, earned cash incentives, and the accounting grant date value of equity
awards as calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 718.

The Role of the Chief Executive Officer

At the People and Compensation Committee’s request, Mr. Cook
provides input regarding the performance and compensation of the other named executive officers. The People and Compensation Committee
considers Mr. Cook’s evaluation and his direct knowledge of each named executive officer’s performance and contributions
when setting compensation. Mr. Cook is not present during People and Compensation Committee deliberations or voting regarding his
own compensation.

The Role of Shareholders

Shareholders are provided the opportunity to cast an annual Say on
Pay advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Shareholder feedback is an important part of the compensation-setting
process. Apple has a long history of proactively engaging with shareholders throughout the year to understand their perspectives
on significant issues, including Company performance, strategy, and executive compensation. The People and Compensation Committee
values the views of our shareholders as expressed both through annual Say on Pay advisory votes and our ongoing outreach and engagement
process.

At the 2025 Annual Meeting, 92% of votes cast on the Say on Pay advisory proposal supported our executive compensation program.
The People and Compensation Committee regularly considers shareholder feedback and the results of Say on Pay votes when setting
compensation for our named executive officers.

Components of Named Executive Officer Total Target Compensation

The total target compensation of our named executive officers has
three basic components: annual base salary, annual cash incentive, and long-term equity awards.

Annual Base Salary

Base salary is a customary, fixed element of compensation intended
to attract and retain executives. When setting the annual base salaries of our named executive officers, the People and Compensation
Committee considers market data provided by its independent compensation consultant and Apple’s financial performance and
size relative to peer companies.

Annual Cash Incentive

Our annual cash incentive program is a performance-based, at-risk
component of our named executive officers’ compensation. Short-term cash incentive awards are granted under the Cash Incentive
Plan. Variable payouts are designed to motivate our named executive officers to deliver strong annual financial results. Additional
details regarding the Cash Incentive Plan for 2025 can be found below in the section entitled “ Cash Incentive Plan - 
2025 Financial Performance Measures and Payout Opportunities.”

Long-Term Equity Awards

We pay for performance and manage Apple for the long term. Consistent
with this approach and our guiding compensation principles, the vast majority of our named executive officers’ total target
compensation is granted in the form of long-term equity incentives that emphasize long-term shareholder value creation and the
retention of a strong executive leadership team through a mix of performance-based and time-based RSU awards. Additional details
regarding these awards can be found below in the section entitled “2025 Long-Term Equity Awards and Results.”

RSU awards with time-based vesting align the interests of our named
executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive
team over the longer term. Vesting schedules for the time-based awards granted to our named executive officers are generally longer
than nearly all of those at our peer companies and in the broader industry.

RSU awards with performance-based vesting are a substantial, at-risk
component of our named executive officers’ compensation tied to Apple’s long-term performance. The number of performance-based
RSUs that vest depends entirely on Apple’s Relative TSR for the performance period. The People and Compensation Committee
chose Relative TSR as it continues to be an objective and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance
of other large companies and to align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating
long-term value.

Summary of CEO Total Target Compensation

The People and Compensation Committee evaluates our executive compensation
program and the total target value of Mr. Cook’s compensation prior to the start of each fiscal year. In determining the
appropriate amount of each compensation component for 2025, the People and Compensation Committee considered numerous factors with
the Board and its independent compensation consultant, including Mr. Cook’s consistently outstanding leadership, the immense
scope and complexity of his role as Apple’s CEO, the Board’s confidence in his long-term strategic decisions, the Company’s
2024 financial results, and shareholder feedback. Balancing the size, scope, and success of Apple relative to our primary peer
group, Mr. Cook’s own pay positioning relative to the CEOs in our primary peer group, and a desire to continue creating meaningful
performance and retention incentives, the People and Compensation Committee set Mr. Cook’s total target compensation for
2025 within the desired pay positioning range and at the same level as his 2024 total target compensation as shown below.

  2025 Total Target CEO Compensation: $59 million                                                                           
  Base Salary: $3 million

  Mr. Cook was granted an equity award with 25% subject to time-based vesting and 75% subject to performance-based vesting  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

No changes were made to the amount of Mr. Cook’s base salary or annual cash incentive payout opportunity for 2025. The
People and Compensation Committee also maintained the total target value of Mr. Cook’s equity award for 2025 at $50 million
(“2025 Equity Award”). The 2025 Equity Award value and structure is unchanged from the equity award he received
for 2024, with 75% of the award granted in the form of performance-based RSUs. This structure continues to emphasize long-term
shareholder growth and alignment while recognizing the growth and success Mr. Cook has continually delivered to shareholders
during his tenure and the ongoing impact of his leadership on Apple’s short- and long-term success.

  Equity awards granted to Mr. Cook are designed to focus on Apple’s                                                                     Cumulative TSR, includes reinvestment

  During his tenure, the vast majority of Mr. Cook’s compensation has been delivered through long-term equity awards. The size

  our shareholders under his leadership. Since Mr. Cook was promoted to CEO in 2011 and through the end of 2025, Apple’s cumulative                                             
  TSR increased approximately 2,162%, significantly outpacing the S& P 500, and Apple’s market capitalization grew by more                                                      
  than $3.4 trillion.

Summary of Other Named Executive Officer Total Target Compensation

The total target compensation of our five other named executive officers, Kevan Parekh, Kate Adams, Sabih Khan, Luca Maestri,
and Deirdre O’ Brien consists of the three basic components of our executive compensation program - base salary,
a Cash Incentive Plan opportunity, and long-term equity awards - in a straightforward and effective way.

Taking into account individual and Company performance, as well as
shareholder feedback, which has consistently confirmed support for the amount and structure of our other named executive
officers’ compensation, the People and Compensation Committee determined that the target compensation of our named executive
officers remains competitive, continues to be commensurate with Apple’s performance and significantly larger size and scope
compared to other companies, and is appropriately aligned with our guiding principles and the scope of each named executive officer’s
role. Since 2014, the total target compensation for our named executive officers has generally comprised an annual base salary
of $1,000,000, a target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity of 200% of base salary, and a target equity award of $20,000,000. Ms. Adams,
Mr. Khan and Ms. O’ Brien each received total target compensation at this level for 2025, with their equity awards granted
in the form of RSUs balanced with 50% of the equity award subject to performance-based vesting and 50% subject to time-based vesting,
to encourage long-term performance, retention, and alignment with shareholders’ interests.

In August 2024, as part of a planned succession, Apple announced
that Luca Maestri would transition from the CFO role, and Kevan Parekh, who previously served as Apple’s Vice President,
Financial Planning and Analysis, would become Apple’s CFO and join the executive team on January 1, 2025. Mr. Maestri’s
and Mr. Parekh’s 2025 total target compensation has the same structure as our other named executive officers’ 2025
compensation, including base salary, Cash Incentive Plan opportunity, and long-term equity awards, with their amounts pro-rated
based on their time in their respective roles during fiscal 2025.

The total target compensation for Mr. Maestri for 2025 comprised
an annual base salary of $1,000,000 that was reduced to $750,000 as of January 1, 2025, a target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity
of 100% of paid base salary, and a target equity award for his previous role as CFO of $5,000,000 with 50% of the equity award
subject to performance-based vesting and 50% subject to time-based vesting. Mr. Maestri continues to report to Mr. Cook and lead
Apple’s Corporate Services teams, and his 2025 annual time-based RSU award for this role had a target value of $7,500,000
with the same four-year vesting schedule generally applicable to our non-executive team employees.

The total target compensation for Mr. Parekh for 2025 comprised an
annual base salary of $610,000 increased to $1,000,000 as of January 1, 2025, a target Cash Incentive Plan opportunity of 175%
of paid base salary, and a target equity award of $16,750,000 with 50% of the equity award subject to performance-based vesting
and 50% subject to time-based vesting.

Additional details regarding our named executive officers’
2025 compensation can be found below in the sections entitled “ Cash Incentive Plan - 2025 Financial Performance Measures
and Payout Opportunities” and “2025 Long-Term Equity Awards and Results.”

Cash Incentive Plan - 2025 Financial Performance Measures
and Payout Opportunities

Our Cash Incentive Plan awards are designed to motivate and reward
our named executive officers for delivering strong performance against annual financial goals. As in prior years, the People and
Compensation Committee chose net sales and operating income, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
as the financial performance measures for the 2025 Cash Incentive Plan awards. Net sales and operating income continue to reflect
commonly recognized key measures of overall Company performance and profitability and are drivers of shareholder value creation.

Payouts for our named executive officers under the Cash Incentive
Plan are first determined quantitatively based on an equal weighting of the net sales and operating income performance measures.
The target payout opportunity for each of the net sales and operating income performance measures was 100% of annual base salary
for our named executive officers, other than Mr. Maestri and Mr. Parekh due to the transition in their respective roles. Threshold
performance would result in a payout equal to 50% of target and maximum performance would result in a payout equal to 200% of target
for each of the performance measures. If the threshold goal is not achieved for a financial performance measure, there is no payout
for that measure. The total payout opportunity for each financial performance measure is capped at 200%. Payouts for our named
executive officers are linearly interpolated for achievement between goal levels.

2025 Financial Performance Goals

The People and Compensation Committee considers factors relevant to the current fiscal year when it sets the net sales and
operating income goals for the annual Cash Incentive Plan awards because each year presents a unique set of challenges and
business conditions for our executives to navigate. Financial results from prior years are used as a reference point, but
the annual goals are set to align pay with performance that would reflect strong financial results commensurate with the projected
business and economic conditions for the current fiscal year. The goal-setting process for 2025 presented a unique set of
challenges due to an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, including trade policies and impacts and foreign currency fluctuations.

As part of its goal-setting process for 2025, the People and Compensation
Committee assessed a range of business scenarios that could impact net sales and operating income results for the year, considering
multiple factors and operational risks, and once again focusing on the underlying business performance rather than the absolute
growth rates. Acknowledging the risks, challenges, and uncertainties in the 2025 projections, as well as the exceptional efforts
that would be required of our executive team to continue to deliver results at a sustained level year-over-year, the People and
Compensation Committee set net sales and operating income goals at appropriately rigorous levels for the year. For net sales, the
threshold, target, and maximum goals were $380 billion, $391 billion, and $402 billion, respectively. For operating income, the
threshold, target, and maximum goals were $113 billion, $118.5 billion, and $124 billion, respectively. The threshold goals
represented the minimum level of achievement for a named executive officer to receive an annual cash incentive payout. The target
goals represented an underlying growth rate that, while challenging to achieve based on the considerations noted above, would also
represent strong financial performance on an underlying basis commensurate with the target payout opportunity. The maximum goals
represented exceptional financial performance for the year, based on the business scenarios considered.

2025 Financial Performance Results

  Net Sales ($B)      Operating Income ($B)  

For 2025, we reported net sales of $416.2 billion and operating income
of $133.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of six percent ($25.2 billion) and eight percent ($9.9 billion), respectively.
These achievements far exceeded expectations for the year and resulted in a maximum payout opportunity. In evaluating the
performance of the Company and the named executive officers in retrospect at the end of the year, the People and Compensation Committee
evaluated the results in the context of the approved goals, as well as alternate scenarios considered at the time the goals were
set. 2025 was an extraordinary year with an all-time revenue record of $416.2 billion, with growth in iPhone, Mac, iPad, and
Services, and all-time records in the vast majority of markets we track. These results reflect the tremendous customer enthusiasm
for Apple products and services, as well as our deep commitment to innovation. The net sales and operating income results
delivered for the year exceeded the maximum financial goals considered, resulting in a maximum payout opportunity for each named
executive officer. Accordingly, the People and Compensation Committee awarded maximum Cash Incentive Plan payouts to each of our
named executive officers.

2025 Long-Term Equity Awards and Results

When setting the value of equity awards for our named executive officers, the People and Compensation Committee considers
the size and performance of Apple relative to peer companies and the scope of our named executive officers’ roles. Each
named executive officer, other than Mr. Cook, was granted a long-term equity award on September 29, 2024 of 50% performance-based
and 50% time-based RSUs. Mr. Maestri was also granted a time-based RSU award for his current role of Vice President, Corporate
Services. Mr. Cook was granted a long-term equity award on September 29, 2024 of 75% performance-based and 25% time-based
RSUs. The equity awards granted in 2025 were granted under, and subject to, the terms of the Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock
Plan (“2022 Plan”).

2025 Performance-Based RSUs

The People and Compensation Committee continued to use Relative TSR
as the metric for performance-based RSUs granted during 2025, with the S& P 500 as the comparative group because it continues
to be an objective and meaningful metric to evaluate our performance against the performance of other large companies and aligns
the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders in creating long-term value.

Performance-based RSUs are a substantial, at-risk component of our
named executive officers’ compensation tied to Apple’s long-term performance. The number of performance-based RSUs
that vest, if any, depends entirely on Relative TSR for the applicable performance period. To earn the target number of performance-based
RSUs, Apple must achieve above-median performance at the 55th percentile of the S& P 500.

We measure Relative TSR based on the change in each company’s
stock price during the applicable performance period, taking into account any dividends paid during that period, which are assumed
to be reinvested in the stock. A 20-day trading averaging period is used to determine the beginning and ending stock price values
used to calculate the total shareholder return of Apple and the other companies in the S& P 500. The 20-day trading averaging
period mitigates the impact on the long-term Relative TSR results of one-day or short-term stock price fluctuations at the beginning
or end of the performance period. The change in stock price value from the beginning to the end of the period is divided by the
beginning stock price value to determine TSR.

The performance-based RSUs granted on September 29, 2024, have a
three-year performance period from the beginning of 2025 through the end of 2027. Subject to the terms of the award agreements,
between zero and 200% of the target number of performance-based RSUs will vest on October 1, 2027, depending on Apple’s Relative
TSR percentile ranking for the performance period, as follows:

The target number of performance-based RSUs granted to our named
executive officers was determined by dividing the target performance-based RSU value by the closing stock price on the date of
grant. The target value of the performance-based RSUs for each of our named executive officers is as follows:

The grant date fair values of these RSUs are reported in the “ Summary
Compensation Table - 2025, 2024, and 2023.”

Performance-Based RSU 2025 Results

On October 1, 2024, Mr. Cook, Ms. Adams, Mr. Khan, Mr. Maestri, and
Ms. O’ Brien each vested in performance-based RSUs that were granted on September 26, 2021. Between zero and 200% of the target
number of these performance-based RSUs were scheduled to vest based on Apple’s Relative TSR percentile ranking for the applicable
performance period, with a maximum 200% vesting for performance at or above the 85th percentile.

For the three-year performance period from September 26, 2021 through
September 28, 2024, Ms. Adams, Mr. Khan, Mr. Maestri, and Ms. O’ Brien each vested in 127,282 performance-based RSUs, and
Mr. Cook vested in 477,301 performance-based RSUs, in each case representing 187% of the target number of performance-based RSUs
granted.

2025 Time-Based RSUs

Equity awards with time-based vesting align the interests of our
named executive officers with the interests of our shareholders by promoting the stability and retention of a high-performing executive
team over the longer term. Based on analysis from the People and Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant,
we set the vesting schedules for time-based RSUs granted to our named executive officers longer than the vast majority of those
at our peer companies and companies in the broader market.

Time-based RSUs granted under the long-term equity award to our named
executive officers on September 29, 2024 generally vest in three equal annual installments over approximately four and one-half
years, with the first installment vesting on April 1, 2027 (approximately two and one-half years following the grant date), subject
to the terms of the award agreements.

The separate time-based RSU award granted to Mr. Maestri on September
29, 2024 will vest semi-annually in eight equal installments over four years. The first installment vested on April 15, 2025 and
the remaining installments vest every six months thereafter, subject to the terms of the award agreement.

The grant date fair value for these RSUs is reported in the “ Summary
Compensation Table - 2025, 2024, and 2023.”

Dividend Equivalents

All equity awards granted to our employees in 2025 have dividend
equivalent rights. The dividend equivalents will only pay out if and to the extent that the time-based vesting and performance-based
vesting conditions have been met for the underlying RSUs.

Other Compensation and Benefits

Our named executive officers are also eligible to participate in
our Apple Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ ESPP”), health and welfare programs, 401(k) plan, tenure-based service
awards, matching gifts, vacation cash-out, product discount, and other compensation and benefit programs on the same basis as other
employees. Items or services provided to our named executive officers that may be considered perquisites are limited, as discussed
below and reported in “ Summary Compensation Table - 2025, 2024, and 2023.”

Deferred Compensation Plan

Our named executive officers are eligible to defer a portion of their
base salary and their annual Cash Incentive Plan payout under the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan, as discussed below in
“ Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation - 2025.”

Other Personal Benefits

We provide risk-based security services for our employees, including
our named executive officers, as determined to be necessary by our security team. We consider the security measures provided to
our named executive officers to be reasonable and necessary expenses for the benefit of Apple and not a personal benefit. In the
interests of security and efficiency based on our global profile and the highly visible nature of Mr. Cook’s role as CEO,
the Board also requires that Mr. Cook use private aircraft for all business and personal travel. Mr. Cook recognizes imputed taxable
income and is not provided a tax reimbursement for personal use of private aircraft. On occasion, our named executive officers,
and personal guests, may attend company-sponsored or business-related entertainment events. Although their attendance serves a
business purpose, it may not be directly related to their role and responsibilities. As a result, our named executive officers
may recognize imputed taxable income related to their attendance at such events depending on their respective roles and responsibilities,
and we do not provide an associated tax reimbursement or gross-up. In accordance with SEC disclosure rules, the aggregate incremental
costs associated with these activities, if any, is reported in the “ Summary Compensation Table - 2025, 2024, and 2023.”

 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Compensation Upon Termination of Employment

Our named executive officers do not have employment contracts or
guaranteed cash severance arrangements and are not entitled to acceleration of their equity awards or any other payments upon a
change in control.

The time-based RSU agreements for all our employees, including Mr.
Cook, generally provide for full accelerated vesting upon a termination due to death unless otherwise necessary or required to
address certain foreign laws. The time-based RSU agreements for all our employees, other than Mr. Cook, provide for pro-rata accelerated
vesting upon a termination due to disability. The performance-based RSU award agreements for our named executive officers, other
than Mr. Cook, provide for pro-rata accelerated vesting upon a termination due to death or disability.

The time-based and performance-based RSU agreements for Mr. Cook
provide for continued full vesting upon a termination due to disability, with settlement occurring on the originally scheduled
vesting dates. Mr. Cook’s outstanding equity awards include a retirement vesting provision approved by the People and Compensation
Committee in recognition of the unique impact of his leadership decisions on the long-term growth and success of Apple and to facilitate
thoughtful succession planning when appropriate. Retirement is defined as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60
years of age and completing at least 10 years of service with Apple. Mr. Cook has met these requirements.

In the event of Mr. Cook’s termination due to retirement on
or after the first anniversary of the grant date, his 2025 time-based RSUs are structured to vest on a pro rata basis based on
the length of his employment between the grant date and his termination date. Unless otherwise determined by the People and Compensation
Committee, Mr. Cook’s outstanding performance-based RSU agreements provide for a continued right to receive the full number
of earned shares underlying the performance-based RSUs on the original vesting dates upon a termination due to death, disability,
or termination of employment due to retirement that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. If Mr. Cook retires
on or after the first anniversary of the grant date, the shares underlying his time-based and performance-based RSU awards will
be released on the originally scheduled vesting date, subject to the attainment of the performance goals for the performance-based
RSUs. The delivery of the vested shares underlying Mr. Cook’s equity awards and any dividend equivalents that have accrued
on such awards are not accelerated upon retirement.

Governance and Other Considerations

Recoupment of Compensation

The terms of all outstanding time-based and performance-based RSU
awards held by our named executive officers in 2025 allow us to recoup any shares or other amounts that may be paid in respect
of RSUs if a named executive officer engages in certain acts of misconduct. The compensation recoupment policy also applies to
the awards and payouts granted under the Cash Incentive Plan to our named executive officers. Apple may recover compensation in
the event a named executive officer commits a felony while employed by Apple or if Apple is required to prepare an accounting restatement
as a result of the named executive officer’s misconduct. Apple may also recover compensation in the event a named executive
officer, while employed by Apple or at any time thereafter, engages in a breach of confidentiality; materially breaches any agreement
with Apple; or commits an act of theft, embezzlement, or fraud. Apple also adopted a recovery policy in accordance with Section
10D-1 of the Exchange Act and Nasdaq listing standards, which mandates the recovery of certain erroneously paid performance-based
incentive compensation that may be received by our Section 16 officers on or after October 2, 2023 and during the three completed
fiscal years immediately prior to the fiscal year in which a financial restatement determination is made if Apple has a qualifying
financial restatement, subject to limited exceptions.

Prohibition on Hedging, Pledging, and Short Sales

We prohibit short sales, hedging, and transactions in derivatives
of Apple securities for all Apple personnel, including directors, officers, employees, independent contractors, and consultants.
In addition, we prohibit pledging of Apple stock as collateral by directors and executive officers of Apple. We allow for certain
portfolio diversification transactions, such as investments in exchange funds.

 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Stock Ownership Guidelines

Under our stock ownership guidelines, Mr. Cook is expected to own
shares of Apple stock that have a value equal to 10 times his annual base salary. All other executive officers are expected to
own shares that have a value equal to three times their annual base salary within five years of first becoming subject to the guidelines.
Shares may be owned directly by the individual, owned jointly with or separately by the individual’s spouse, or held in trust
for the benefit of the individual, the individual’s spouse, or the individual’s children. Currently, each 2025 named
executive officer holds shares in excess of these guidelines.

Equity Award Grant Practices

Equity awards are discretionary and are generally granted to our
named executive officers on thefirst day of the applicable fiscal year. In certain circumstances, including the hiring or promotion
of an officer, the People and Compensation Committee may approve grants to be effective at other times. Apple does not currently
grant stock options to its employees. Eligible employees, including our named executive officers, may voluntarily enroll in the
ESPP and receive an option to purchase shares at a discount using payroll deductions accumulated during the prior six-month period.
Purchase dates under the ESPP are generally the last trading days in July and January. The People and Compensation Committee did
not take material non-public information into account when determining the timing and terms of equity awards in 2025, andApple
does not time the disclosure of material non-public information for the purpose of affecting the value of executive compensation.

Risk Considerations

In establishing and reviewing Apple’s executive compensation
program, the People and Compensation Committee considers whether the program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and
has concluded that it does not. See the section entitled “ Corporate Governance - Board Oversight” above for an
additional discussion of risk considerations.

People and Compensation Committee Report

The People and Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed
with management the disclosures contained in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Based on this review and discussion, the
People and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the section entitled “ Compensation Discussion and Analysis”
be included in this Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting.

  (1)      The target grant value of Mr. Cook’s long-term equity award was $50 million for 2025 and 2024, and $40 million for 2023.            
           The target grant value of the long-term equity awards for Ms. Adams, Mr. Khan, and Ms. O’ Brien was $20 million for each            
           of 2025, 2024, and 2023. The target grant value of Mr. Parekh’s long-term equity awards was $16.75 million and the target           
           grant value of Mr. Maestri’s long-term equity awards was $12.5 million for 2025. This column shows the grant date fair              
           value for accounting purposes of the long-term equity awards granted to our named executive officers. The grant date fair           
           value for time-based RSUs is measured in accordance with FASB ASC 718 and based on the closing price of Apple’s common              
           stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value for performance-based RSUs is calculated using a Monte-Carlo model for        
           each award on the date of grant, as determined under FASB ASC 718, based on the probable outcome of the performance condition       
           as of the grant date. The grant date fair value for each award may differ based on the applicable data, assumptions, and estimates  
           used in the model. See footnote 1 to the table entitled “ Grants of Plan-Based Awards—2025.”

Description of Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation

Our named executive officers and Non-Employee
Directors are eligible to participate in the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Deferred Compensation Plan participants
may elect to defer up to 50% of their annual base salary and commissions and up to 90% of their eligible cash bonus, or up to
100% of their annual cash retainer in the case of Non-Employee Directors, by timely completing a deferral election form. Amounts
deferred under the Deferred Compensation Plan, as adjusted for applicable earnings gains and losses and fees, are credited to
an account in the participant’s name and remain fully vested at all times. Participants may select at any time from a diversified
menu of notional investment options that generally mirror the investment options of Apple’s 401(k) plan, and the value of
their Deferred Compensation Plan account balance may increase or decrease based on the performance of their selected investment
options. In 2025, annual returns on the investment options available for the Deferred Compensation Plan generally ranged from
-0.52% to 23.20%.

Deferred Compensation Plan participants
may elect to receive distributions of their deferred amounts either upon separation from service or as of a specified in-service
distribution date. Distributions will be made in a lump sum payment unless the participant elects installment payments over a
period between two and 10 years. A Deferred Compensation Plan participant also may request to receive a hardship distribution
on account of an eligible unforeseeable emergency. If a Deferred Compensation Plan participant dies before receiving a complete
distribution of their account, the remaining account will be paid to their beneficiaries in a lump sum by December 31 of
the year following the participant’s death.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control

We do not have any cash severance arrangements with our named executive officers and none of our named executive officers’
equity awards outstanding as of 2025 fiscal year-end provide for acceleration or a right to receive shares in connection with
a change of control or termination of employment for reasons other than death, disability, and, for Mr. Cook, retirement.
Retirement is defined as a termination of employment after reaching at least 60 years of age and at least 10 years of service
with Apple.

Equity Award Treatment Upon Termination of Employment

CEO Awards

Subject to the terms of the award agreements, Mr. Cook’s time-based RSUs provide for accelerated vesting in full upon
disability or death. Mr. Cook’s 2022 time-based RSUs provide for a continued right to receive the full number of unvested
shares underlying the time-based RSUs upon retirement that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Mr.
Cook’s 2023, 2024, and 2025 time-based RSUs provide for a continued right to receive a pro-rata number of unvested shares
underlying the time-based RSUs upon retirement that occurs on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. The pro-rata
vesting is determined based on Mr. Cook’s period of employment during the vesting period. The delivery of the vested
shares underlying Mr. Cook’s time-based RSUs and any dividend equivalents that have accrued on such RSUs is not accelerated
upon disability or retirement and will continue to be delivered on the originally scheduled vesting dates. If Mr. Cook terminates
employment due to retirement before the first anniversary of the grant date of an outstanding time-based award, he will not
have a right to any unvested time-based RSUs under that award.

Mr. Cook’s outstanding performance-based
RSUs provide for a continued right to receive shares that are earned based upon full or partial attainment of the award’s
performance conditions upon a termination of employment due to death, disability, or retirement that occurs on or after the first
anniversary of the grant date. If Mr. Cook terminates employment due to retirement before the first anniversary of the grant date
of an outstanding performance-based award, he will not have a right to any of the earned but unvested performance-based RSUs.

Other Named Executive Officer Awards

The time-based RSUs held by our other
named executive officers, subject to the terms of the award agreements, provide for partial accelerated vesting of the RSUs scheduled
to vest on the next applicable vesting date following a termination of employment due to disability, and for full accelerated
vesting upon death. Performance-based RSUs provide for a partial waiver of the service vesting condition upon the death or disability
of the award recipient, with the number of shares that vest determined at the end of the performance period, based on actual performance
results and prorated based on the officer’s length of employment during the performance period.

The following table shows the estimated

fiscal year-end had their employment terminated due to death or disability for each of our named executive officers, and retirement

Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and our Total Shareholder Return
Long-term equity incentives represent a vast majority of our named executive officers’ total target compensation and
our stock price performance, measured by TSR, is the key driver of Compensation Actually Paid. We also use Relative TSR as
the key performance measure for our performance-based RSUs. Over 2025, Apple’s TSR on an absolute basis was 12.66%,
while the TSR of our primary peer group was 35.48%. Apple’s Relative TSR (the peer group for performance-based RSUs)
was strong, resulting in above-target payout for the performance-based RSUs with applicable performance periods ending in
2025. Further, the outstanding performance-based RSUs (granted in 2024 and 2025) continue to trend towards target or above-target
payouts due to strong TSR relative to the members of the S& P 500. Compensation Actually Paid to our named executive officers
and TSR are tightly linked.

Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Income
Net Income is generally a key indicator of company profitability and, for Apple, can contribute to changes in our stock price,
which, in turn, drives Compensation Actually Paid. There is no direct correlation between Net Income and Compensation Actually
Paid from 2021 to 2025 as we do not use Net Income as a financial measure in our executive compensation program. Operating
Income and Net Sales are the two financial performance measures for our Cash Incentive Plan.

Relationship Between Compensation Actually Paid and Net Sales
Net Sales is the financial measure, in addition to Operating Income, that the People and Compensation Committee has set for
our Cash Incentive Plan. Net Sales and Operating Income are equally the most important financial metrics in determining Compensation
Actually Paid behind Relative TSR. Similar to Operating Income, Net Sales were consistently strong from 2021 to 2025, and
this sustained performance led to above target or maximum bonus payouts in each of 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025, which
increased Compensation Actually Paid to our named executive officers.

Other Relevant Financial Performance Measures
For 2025, the following list represented
the most important financial performance measures used by Apple to link Compensation Actually Paid with our financial performance:
Net
Operating Income
Relative TSR

CEO Pay Ratio - 2025

We offer a wide range of benefits to our
global employee population, and we are committed to paying our employees competitively and equitably based on their role.

We identified a new median employee for 2025. We determined our median compensated employee by using base salary, bonuses,
commissions, and grant date fair value of equity awards granted to employees in 2025 as our consistently applied compensation
measure. We applied this measure to our global employee population as of September 27, 2025, the last day of our 2025 fiscal
year, and annualized base salaries for permanent full-time and part-time employees who did not work the full year.

We calculated the median compensated employee’s
2025 annual total compensation using the same methodology that is used to calculate our CEO’s annual total compensation
in the table entitled “ Summary Compensation Table - 2025, 2024, and 2023.” The 2025 annual total compensation
of our CEO was $74,294,811, the 2025 annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was $139,483, and the ratio
of these amounts is 533 to 1. The compensation included in the pay ratio reflects a reasonable estimate consistent with SEC rules
based on the methodology we described above. Because SEC rules for identifying a median compensated employee allow companies to
apply certain exclusions, include estimates, and adopt different methodologies that reflect their employee population and compensation
practices, the ratio above may not be comparable to the CEO pay ratio reported by other companies.

Proposal No. 2

Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

The Audit Committee has re-appointed
Ernst & Young LLP as Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm and as auditors of
Apple’s consolidated financial statements for 2026. The Audit Committee reviews the performance of the independent
registered public accounting firm annually. In making the determination to re-appoint Ernst & Young
for 2026, the Audit Committee considered, among other factors, the independence and performance of Ernst &
Young, and the quality and candor of Ernst & Young’s communications with the Audit Committee and
management. Ernst & Young has served as Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm since 2009.

At the Annual Meeting, our shareholders
are being asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as Apple’s independent registered public accounting
firm for 2026. Although ratification of the Audit Committee’s appointment of Ernst & Young is not required,
we value the opinions of our shareholders and believe that shareholder ratification of the appointment is a good corporate governance
practice. In the event of a negative vote on this proposal, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if this appointment
is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at
any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that it would be in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders.
Representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a
statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to questions.

The following table shows the fees
billed by Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm for the years ended September 27,

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit
Services Performed by the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Apple maintains an auditor independence
policy that, among other things, prohibits Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm from performing non-financial
consulting services for Apple, such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that
the Audit Committee approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services expected to be performed each year by the
independent registered public accounting firm and the related budget, and that the Audit Committee be provided with quarterly
reporting on actual spending. This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple’s independent
registered public accounting firm for other permissible non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit Committee.
In accordance with this policy, the Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed by Apple’s independent registered
public accounting firm in 2025.

Proposal No. 3

Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation

In accordance with the requirements of
Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the related rules of the SEC, our shareholders have the opportunity to cast an annual
advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the SEC’s compensation
disclosure rules, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables, and the
narrative disclosures that accompany the executive compensation tables.

Motivating and retaining an exceptional
leadership team is a key factor in enabling Apple’s long-term success. Our executive compensation program is designed to
retain strong, values-driven leaders. We have clear guiding principles and sound compensation policies and practices that align
the pay of our named executive officers with the Company’s financial performance and shareholder returns, taking into consideration
the size, scope, and success of Apple’s business. The compensation paid to our named executive officers in 2025 reflects
their contributions to Apple’s success and continues to demonstrate alignment with Apple’s strong financial results
and the interests of our shareholders. The vast majority of our named executive officers’ compensation is at-risk and delivered
through short-term cash incentives and long-term equity awards. We encourage shareholders to read the section entitled “ Compensation
Discussion and Analysis,” beginning on page 38, which describes the details of our executive compensation program
and the People and Compensation Committee’s decision-making process with respect to our executive compensation program.

92% of votes cast on the Say on Pay advisory
proposal at the 2025 Annual Meeting were in favor of our executive compensation program. This result reflects the positive shareholder
response to the overall structure of our executive compensation program.

Shareholders are being asked to approve
the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:

RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to
the named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC’s executive compensation disclosure
rules, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures
that accompany the executive compensation tables, is hereby approved.

As an advisory vote, this proposal is not
binding on Apple, the Board, or the People and Compensation Committee. However, the People and Compensation Committee and the
Board value the opinions expressed by shareholders in their votes on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when
making future compensation decisions regarding named executive officers.

We expect the next advisory Say on Pay
vote will occur at the 2027 annual meeting of shareholders.

Proposal No. 4

Approval of the Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, as Amended and Restated

At the Annual Meeting, shareholders
are being asked to approve the Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the “ Director
Plan”), which was approved by the Board on November 4, 2025, subject to shareholder approval. The material features of
the Director Plan are summarized below. The Director Plan is included in its entirety as Annex A to this Proxy Statement.

The Director Plan was last approved by
shareholders at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. We are asking shareholders to approve the amendment to the Director Plan
to extend the term to February 23, 2036, as the Director Plan is currently set to expire on November 13, 2027.

The Director Plan is the only active equity incentive plan for Non-Employee Directors. As of September 27, 2025, the last
day of our 2025 fiscal year, unvested full-value awards covering 8,643 shares remained outstanding under the Director Plan.

The shares subject to the Director Plan, as set out in this proposal, are restated to reflect our 4-for-1 stock split on August
28, 2020. We are not requesting that shareholders approve an increase in the maximum number of shares that may be issued or
transferred pursuant to awards under the Director Plan. Based on a review of our historical grant practices, we estimate that
the shares currently reserved for grant under the Director Plan should meet Apple’s equity grant needs to its Non-Employee
Directors for approximately 10 years. The shares reserved may, however, last for more or less than 10 years depending on currently
unknown factors, such as the number of grant recipients, future grant practices, and Apple’s stock price.

Description of Non-Employee Director Stock Plan

The following is a summary of the principal
features of the Director Plan. This summary does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the Director
Plan. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Director Plan, which is included in its entirety as
Annex A to this Proxy Statement.

Purpose

The purposes of the Director Plan are to
retain the services of qualified individuals who are not employees of the Company to serve as members of the Board and to secure
for the Company the benefits of the incentives inherent in increased common stock ownership by such individuals by granting such
individuals awards in respect of Apple shares.

Eligibility

Only directors who are not employees of
Apple or any of its subsidiaries may participate in the Director Plan. All seven of Apple’s Non-Employee Directors currently
participate in the Director Plan.

Shares Reserve

Authorized and unissued shares of Apple’s
common stock will be issued under the Director Plan.

Maximum Share Reserve. A cumulative
total of 44,800,000 shares of Apple’s common stock may be delivered pursuant to awards granted under the Director Plan.
As of September 27, 2025, 4,092,836 shares remained available for future award grants under the Director Plan and 8,643 shares
were subject to awards then outstanding under the Director Plan.

 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Other Share Counting Rules. Shares
issued pursuant to restricted stock unit awards shall count against the share limit as two shares for every one share issued in
connection with the award. Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of options shall count against the share limit as one share
for every one share to which such exercise relates. If awards are settled in cash, the shares that would have been delivered had
there been no cash settlement shall not be counted against the share limit. If awards are forfeited or are terminated for
any reason before settlement or exercise, then the shares underlying such awards shall again become available for awards under
the Director Plan, provided that any one share subject to a restricted stock unit award that is forfeited or terminated shall
be credited as two shares when determining the number of shares that shall again become available for awards under the Director
Plan. Shares that are exchanged by a director or withheld by Apple to pay the exercise price of an option granted under the plan,
as well as any shares exchanged or withheld to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award, will not be available
for subsequent awards under the Director Plan.

Limit on Compensation

In no event shall the compensation payable
by the Company to a Non-Employee Director for services performed as a Non-Employee Director, including the grant date value (determined
under U. S. generally accepted accounting principles) of awards, cash retainers, and other compensation, exceed $1.5 million in
the aggregate in any fiscal year.

Administration

The Administrator of the Plan is the Board. The Board has full authority to take any actions it deems necessary or advisable
for the administration of the Director Plan in its sole discretion. The Board may delegate ministerial, non-discretionary
functions to individuals who are officers or employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or to third parties.

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units may be granted under
the Director Plan. A restricted stock unit or “ RSU” is a bookkeeping entry representing the equivalent of one share,
subject to the terms and conditions of the award, and represents an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company. Unless earlier
forfeited under the terms of the Director Plan, granted restricted stock units generally settle on or as soon as administratively
practical after vesting. Restricted stock units granted under the Director Plan do not carry any shareholder rights, including
voting or dividend rights, but do have dividend equivalent rights, which are credited to a Non-Employee Director and subject to
the same vesting, payment, and other terms and conditions as the underlying restricted stock units, except they are paid in cash.

The Director Plan provides that each Non-Employee Director serving on the Board immediately following Apple’s annual
meeting of shareholders each year automatically receives a grant of RSUs on the date of the annual meeting (each, an “ Annual
Director Award”). The number of RSUs subject to each Annual Director Award is determined by dividing $310,000 (or such
other amount, as determined by the Board prior to the date of such annual meeting) by the per-share fair market value of Apple’s
common stock on the date of grant, rounded to the nearest whole share. All Annual Director Awards are scheduled to vest on
the February 1 that occurs in the year following the year in which the award is granted.

A Non-Employee Director who is newly elected or appointed to the Board other than in connection with an annual meeting of
shareholders generally also would receive a grant of RSUs upon his or her election or appointment (each, an “ Initial
Director Award”), except that a Non-Employee Director who either (i) joined the Board after February 1 of a particular
year and prior to the annual meeting for that year or (ii) was an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries immediately
prior to becoming a Non-Employee Director, would not receive an Initial Director Award. The number of RSUs subject to each
Initial Director Award is determined in the same manner as described above for Annual Director Awards, but the grant date
value of the award is pro-rated based on the portion of the year that has passed since the last annual meeting. Initial Director
Awards vest on the vesting date established for the Annual Director Awards made at the last annual meeting prior to the date
on which the Non-Employee Director joined the Board.

 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Stock Options

The Director Plan permits the grant of
stock options if the Board determines that the grant of stock options is in the best interests of Apple and its shareholders.
If stock options are granted, the options would be required to have a per share exercise price not less than the fair market value
of a share of Apple’s common stock on the date of grant, would be immediately vested unless otherwise specified at the time
of grant, and would expire ten years from the date of grant. There are currently no stock options outstanding under the Director
Plan.

Restrictions on Transfer

Except as described below, awards under
the Director Plan generally are not transferable by the recipient other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution,
and stock options are generally exercisable, during the recipient’s lifetime, only by the Non-Employee Director. The Board
has discretion, however, to allow for an award to be transferred to a Non-Employee Director’s family members or to one or
more trusts established in whole or in part for the benefit of one or more of such family members.

No Repricing

No adjustment may be made to the plan or
any stock option under the Director Plan (by amendment, substitution, cancellation and regrant, exchange, or other means) that
would constitute a repricing of the per-share exercise price of the option except for an adjustment to reflect a stock split or
similar event provided in the Director Plan or any repricing that might be approved by shareholders.

Termination of Service

If a Non-Employee Director ceases to serve as a member of the Board for any reason other than death, that director’s
outstanding and unvested awards generally would terminate on the date the director ceased to be a member of the Board. Upon
the death of a Non-Employee Director, all unvested awards would become fully vested. Any options that are exercisable at the
time of the Non-Employee Director’s termination other than for death may be exercised at any time within 90 days after
the date of such termination, provided that if the termination is as a result of such Non-Employee Director’s death,
the options may be exercised by his or her Beneficiary at any time within three years after the date of such death. At the
end of the applicable 90-day or three-year period, any unexercised options shall expire.

Adjustments; Corporate Transactions; Change of Control

The share limit and the number and kind
of shares available under the Director Plan and any outstanding awards, as well as the exercise prices of awards, are subject
to adjustment in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends,
or other similar events. Upon a change of control, the Director Plan provides for vesting of outstanding awards, pro-rated based
on the portion of the vesting period that has elapsed as of the date of the change of control.

Amendment and Termination

The Board has the authority to amend or
terminate the Director Plan at any time, including the authority to prospectively change the value and relative mixture of stock
options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants to Non-Employee Directors subject to the compensation limit described
above, the methodology for determining the number of shares of Apple’s common stock subject to these grants, and the vesting
and other terms and conditions of these grants without shareholder approval. However, the Board may not increase the number of
shares available for issuance under the Director Plan without shareholder approval.

Term

The amended and restated Director
Plan will become effective upon shareholder approval. If shareholders approve this proposal, unless earlier terminated by the
Board, the Director Plan will expire on February 23, 2036. No further awards would be granted under the Director Plan after
that date.

 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Federal Income Tax Consequences

The following is a brief summary of the
U. S. federal income tax consequences applicable to awards granted under the Director Plan based on the federal income tax laws
in effect on the date of this Proxy Statement. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not address all matters
relevant to a particular participant based on their specific circumstances. The summary expressly does not discuss the income
tax laws of any state, municipality, or non-U. S. taxing jurisdiction, or the gift, estate, excise (including the rules applicable
to deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), or other tax laws other than U. S. federal income
tax law. The following is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purposes of avoiding taxpayer penalties.
Because individual circumstances may vary, we advise all participants to consult their own tax advisor concerning the tax implications
of awards granted under the Director Plan.

A recipient of a stock option will not
have taxable income upon the grant of the stock option. A participant will recognize ordinary income upon exercise of a stock
option in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares and the exercise price on the date of
exercise. Any gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares generally will be a capital gain or loss.

A participant is not deemed to receive
any taxable income at the time an award of restricted stock unit is granted. When vested RSUs (and dividend equivalent rights,
if any) are settled and distributed, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount of cash or the fair market
value of shares received less the amount paid for such restricted stock units, if any.

Apple will be allowed a tax deduction for
the amount recognized as ordinary income by a Non-Employee Director upon vesting or exercise.

Future Plan Benefits

None of Apple’s employees, including
its executive officers and the named executive officers, are eligible to participate in the Director Plan. Outstanding RSU awards
under the Director Plan are reported on page 32 in the table entitled “ Director Compensation - 2025.” As of the
date of this Proxy Statement, no new grants were made to our current Non-Employee Directors, any nominee for the Board for the
Annual Meeting, or any associate of any of our directors or executive officers. On the date of the Annual Meeting, Non-Employee
Directors duly elected to the Board will be granted an Annual Director Award as described in the “ Restricted Stock Units”
section on page 69 of this Proposal. The number of RSUs granted and the grant value of such RSUs is unknown and indeterminable
until the Non-Employee Directors are elected and the per share fair market value of Apple’s common stock on the date of
grant is known. Any other grants that may be made under the Director Plan in the future are indeterminable at this time. As such,
the future plan benefits under the Director Plan have been omitted.

Aggregate Past Grants Under the Director Plan

Since the inception of the Director Plan,
the following equity awards have been granted to our Non-Employee Directors, with the number of shares adjusted for stock splits.

Shareholder Proposals

At Apple, we believe business can and should be a force for good. Our teams around the world work to infuse Apple’s
deeply held values into everything we make. Apple engages with stakeholders as part of our commitment to advance meaningful
change and find novel solutions to pressing challenges. We welcome dialogue, including regarding the issues presented in the
proposal below, and contacted the proponent to discuss their concerns and provide information about Apple’s policies
and practices. Apple continues to build effective programs designed to tackle challenges and to communicate our progress through
transparent reporting.

The proposal below was submitted by a
shareholder under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. This proposal, and the supporting statement, is included as submitted to
us by the proponent. Apple’s opposition statement, as well as the Board’s voting recommendation, immediately follow
the shareholder proposal.

  Proposal                                                                                                                               Board Voting

In October 2025, the Company submitted
no-action requests to the Staff of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance asking the Staff to concur with the Company’s
view that certain proposals submitted to the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement could be properly excluded under SEC
Rule 14a-8. The Staff subsequently announced that they would not respond to most requests for exclusion of shareholder proposals
under SEC Rule 14a-8.

Following that announcement, and based on the Company’s review of the provisions of Rule 14a-8,
prior Staff guidance on the application of Rule 14a-8, and judicial decisions, we determined that it was appropriate to exclude
a shareholder proposal because the proponent failed to provide required documentation to show that they had continuously owned
the requisite amount of Company securities consistent with SEC Rule 14a-8 and related Staff interpretations.
Prior to submitting our notice of exclusion to the Staff and the proponent, we reached out again to the shareholder to explain
our reason for exclusion and to offer to discuss their proposal.

Identification of Proponents

Proposal No. 5 was submitted for the Annual Meeting by a shareholder who has represented to Apple that they
have continuously been the beneficial owner of a sufficient amount of the Company’s securities for a sufficient time

Proposal No. 5

Shareholder Proposal

Apple has been advised that the National
Center for Public Policy Research intends to submit the following proposal at the Annual Meeting.

China Entanglement Audit

Whereas:

  With escalating U. S.– China trade tensions, Apple could face steep tariff increases.                                                        
  While Apple is apparently shifting some production to India and Vietnam, these regions still depend                                          
  China may restrict support from Chinese engineers or suppliers to Apple’s new operations                                                     
  Greater China — encompassing Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan — accounted for                                                           
  The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act further complicates matters. Chinese suppliers linked to                                              
  Apple has previously been the target of Chinese Espionage actions; the company’s proprietary

 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Resolved: Shareholders request that
the Board of Directors of Apple conduct an evaluation and issue a report within the next year, at reasonable cost and excluding
confidential information, assessing risks and costs associated with the company’s continued entanglement with the People’s
Republic of China.

Supporting Statement:

Shareholders need clear, quantified information on:

  The financial exposure under high-tariff scenarios and mitigation strategies.                       
  The dollar value of revenues and profits at risk from regulatory or geopolitical actions in China.  
  The danger and risks associated with intellectual property theft from Chinese firms.                
  The timeline and cost implications of supply chain diversification away from China.                 

A transparent, scenario-based analysis will help shareholders
assess whether current strategies are sufficient to protect Apple’s profitability and long-term growth. Without such disclosure,
investors cannot adequately evaluate the Company’s resilience in the face of mounting geopolitical and economic risks.

For these reasons, we urge shareholders to voteFORthis
proposal.

Apple’s Statement in Opposition to Proposal No. 5

  AGAINST             The Board recommends a vote AGAINST Proposal No. 5 because:                            
  Proposal No. 5      ●                                                                                      

Apple products are designed in California
and made all over the world, with manufacturing, sales, and operations extending to over 50 countries and regions. We work with
millions of people and thousands of innovative businesses to build the best products and services and to effectively serve our
customers around the globe.

The requested report is unnecessary
given we already provide extensive information on our international operations. As a public company with international operations
in over 50 countries and regions, we already regularly update our shareholders as to the nature and extent of our global presence
and any material risks that we face in our business. For example, in our various periodic reports that are filed with the U. S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, we discuss our results of operations by segment, including our Greater China segment, and
provide disclosures covering material risks to our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition, and stock
price. Such disclosures cover, among other things, risks from our international customer base and operations, international trade
restrictions and tariffs, potential exposures due to the geographic concentration of certain of our operations, challenges in
diversifying, and threats to our competitive position if we fail to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights.

We also voluntarily provide additional
information relating to our global supply chain and operations. For example, we have announced significant investments in our
operations in the United States, such as the August 2025 announcement bringing our total U. S. investment to $600 billion over
the next four years and announcing the launch of our new American Manufacturing Program. (1)We also publish annually
our People and Environment in Our Supply Chain progress report(2)where we discuss in detail our programs and expectations
across our global supply chain. Given our extensive disclosures relating to our worldwide operations, including potential risks,
as well as updates on recent investments, we believe the requested report would not provide any additional material information
to shareholders.

The proposal is highly prescriptive and attempts to inappropriately restrict Apple’s ability to manage its own ordinary
business operations and business strategies. Apple operates and sells products and services in numerous countries around the
world to best serve its worldwide customer base. Apple’s decisions regarding where to locate operations involve complex
considerations and analysis of many factors, such as understanding geopolitical conditions, trade policies, regulatory environments,
manufacturing capabilities, consumer preferences, operational considerations, and the ability to serve Apple’s global
customer base, along with financial, legal, tax, and reputational factors. Although the requested report presents its inquiry
as neutral fact-finding, we believe the level of detail and direction in the proposal’s supporting statement suggests
a preferred method of action and would inappropriately infringe on Apple’s ability to manage this complex strategic
work by attempting to dictate Apple’s decisions with respect to our operations and global footprint.

Our Board and management maintain active
oversight of our global operations. The Board oversees this important work, and reviews and discusses with management updates
regarding Apple’s international operations and supply chain management.

Apple’s Board is also responsible for the oversight of significant risks affecting our business and Apple’s Enterprise
Risk Management Program. The Board actively exercises this oversight through regular reviews and discussion with Apple management
handling key risks, and is supported by the Audit and Finance Committee, which has the primary responsibility for assisting
the full Board with its risk oversight duties.

Apple’s Enterprise Risk Management
Program is designed to identify, assess, and monitor our significant business risks, including risks related to our international
operations and supply chain. The program is supported by a Risk Oversight Committee, consisting of our Chief Financial Officer,
General Counsel, Head of Business Assurance, and other senior business leaders, that assists the Audit and Finance Committee with
its general responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management. Through these robust risk management and reporting systems,
Apple is able to continually evaluate and seek to mitigate the risks confronting our business.

The Audit and Finance Committee does not itself prepare financial
statements or perform audits, and its members are not auditors or certifiers of Apple’s financial statements.

The Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for the appointment,
compensation, retention, and oversight of the work performed by Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst
& Young LLP. In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the Audit and Finance Committee carefully reviews the policies and
procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope of the audit, audit fees,
auditor independence matters, performance of the independent auditors, and the extent to which the independent registered public
accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit services.

Ernst & Young has served as Apple’s independent registered
public accounting firm since 2009 and rotates its lead audit engagement partner every five years. The Audit and Finance Committee
is responsible for the oversight of the selection of the lead engagement partner.

Apple maintains an auditor independence policy that, among other
things, prohibits Apple’s independent registered public accounting firm from performing non-financial consulting services,
such as information technology consulting and internal audit services. This policy mandates that the Audit and Finance Committee
approve in advance the audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting
firm and the related budget, and that the Audit and Finance Committee be provided with quarterly reporting on actual spending.
This policy also mandates that Apple may not enter into engagements with Apple’s independent registered public accounting
firm for non-audit services without the express pre-approval of the Audit and Finance Committee.

The Audit and Finance Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited
financial statements for the year ended September 27, 2025, with Apple’s management and Ernst & Young.
The Audit and Finance Committee has also discussed with Ernst & Young the matters required to be discussed by the applicable
requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“ PCAOB”) and the SEC.

The Audit and Finance Committee has also received and reviewed the
written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Ernst & Young’s communications with the Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Ernst &
Young its independence.

Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit
and Finance Committee recommended to the Board that the financial statements referred to above be included in Apple’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2025, for filing with the SEC.

These materials were first sent or made available to shareholders
on January 8, 2026, and include:

  The Notice of 2026 Annual Meeting of Shareholders;                         
  This Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting; and                           
  Apple’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2025.  

If you requested printed versions by mail, these printed proxy materials
also include the proxy card or voting instruction form for the Annual Meeting.

Forward-looking Statements

This document includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
including statements regarding our goals, commitments, and strategies, and our executive compensation program. These statements
involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the
forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including due to the risks, uncertainties, and other important factors
that are discussed in our most recently filed periodic reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q and subsequent filings. We assume
no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.

Proxy Materials are Available on the Internet

Apple uses the internet as the primary means of furnishing proxy
materials to shareholders. We are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the “ Notice of Internet Availability”)
to our shareholders with instructions on how to access the proxy materials online at proxyvote. comor
request a printed copy of the materials.

Shareholders may follow the instructions in the Notice of Internet
Availability to elect to receive future proxy materials in print by mail or electronically by email. We encourage shareholders
to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials online to help reduce the environmental impact of our annual meetings
and reduce Apple’s printing and mailing costs.

Apple’s proxy materials are also available at investor. apple. com.

Eliminating Duplicate Mailings

Apple has adopted a procedure called “householding.”
Under this procedure, Apple may deliver a single copy of the Notice of Internet Availability and, if you requested printed versions
by mail, this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2025, to multiple shareholders
who share the same address, unless Apple has received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders. This procedure
reduces the environmental impact of our annual meetings and reduces Apple’s printing and mailing costs. Shareholders who
participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. Upon written or oral request, Apple will deliver promptly
a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability and, if you requested printed versions by mail, this Proxy Statement and
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2025, to any shareholder that elects not to participate
in householding.

Quorum for the Annual Meeting

Holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual
Meeting must be present at the Annual Meeting or represented by proxy for the transaction of business. This is called a quorum.
Your shares will be counted for purposes of determining if there is a quorum if:

  You are entitled to vote and you are present at the Annual Meeting; or                                                       
  You have properly voted prior to the meeting by proxy online, by phone, or by submitting a proxy card or voting instruction  

Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present. If a quorum is not present, we may propose to adjourn the Annual Meeting and reconvene the Annual
Meeting at a later date.

Inspector of Election

A representative of Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc.
will serve as the inspector of election.

Proxy Solicitation Costs

Apple is paying the costs of the solicitation of proxies. Apple has
retained Georgeson LLC to assist in the distribution of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies from individual shareholders,
as well as brokerage firms, fiduciaries, custodians, and other similar organizations representing beneficial owners of shares for
the Annual Meeting. We have agreed to pay Georgeson a fee of approximately $18,000 plus variable amounts for additional proxy solicitation
services and out-of-pocket expenses.

In addition to solicitations by mail, the proxy solicitor and Apple’s
nominees, officers, and employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies on Apple’s behalf in person, by phone,
or by electronic communication.

Uninstructed Shares

Shareholders of Record

If you are a shareholder of record and you:

  Indicate when voting online or by phone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board; or  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions,                      

then the persons named as proxy holders, Kate Adams and Kevan Parekh,
will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement and as they may determine
in their best judgment with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.

Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name

If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do
not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, then the organization may generally vote
your shares in their discretion on “routine” matters, but cannot vote on “non-routine” matters.

Routine and Non-Routine Proposals

The following proposal is considered a routine matter:

  The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Apple’s independent registered  

A broker or other nominee may generally vote in their discretion
on routine matters, and, therefore, no broker non-votes are expected in connection with Proposal No. 2.

The following proposals are considered non-routine matters:

  Election of directors (Proposal No. 1);                                                                     
  Advisory vote to approve executive compensation (Proposal No. 3);                                           
  Approval of the Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan, as amended and restated (Proposal No. 4); and  
  Shareholder proposal (Proposal No. 5).                                                                      

If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions
from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, that organization will inform the inspector of election that it does
not have the authority to vote on the matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a “broker non-vote.”
Therefore, broker non-votes may exist in connection with Proposal No. 1 and Proposals No. 3 through No. 5.

 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Vote Required to Approve a Proposal

With respect to the election of directors (Proposal No. 1),
Apple’s bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election of directors, the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the
shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting, and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute
a quorum is required to elect a director. An “uncontested election of directors” means an election of directors in
which the number of candidates for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election.

Approval of Proposals No. 2 through No. 5 requires, in
each case, the affirmative vote of (i) a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting,
and (ii) a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions

Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted for purposes of determining
whether a quorum is present. Only “ FOR” and “ AGAINST” votes are counted for purposes of determining the
votes received in connection with each proposal. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on determining whether the
affirmative vote constitutes a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and voting at the Annual Meeting.

In addition, for each proposal, the affirmative vote equal to a majority
of the shares necessary to constitute a quorum is also required for approval. Therefore, broker non-votes and abstentions could
prevent the election of a director or the approval of a proposal because they do not count as affirmative votes.

Confidentiality of Votes

Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify
individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Apple will not disclose the proxy instructions
or ballots of individual shareholders, except:

  To allow for the tabulation and certification of votes;  
  To facilitate a successful proxy solicitation;           
  To assert claims for Apple;                              
  To defend claims against Apple; and                      
  As necessary to meet applicable legal requirements.      

If you write comments on your proxy card or ballot, the proxy card
or ballot may be forwarded to Apple’s management and the Board to review your comments.

Tabulation and Reporting of Voting Results

Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting.
Final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election after the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting. Apple will
publish the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days following the Annual
Meeting.

  (c)      amending any outstanding Awards;

by the Administrator pursuant to the Plan shall be final and binding on all persons, and the Administrator’s determinations
under the Plan need not be the same for all persons. The Administrator shall not be liable for any action or determination made
in good faith, and shall be entitled to indemnification and reimbursement in the manner provided in the Company’s Articles
of Incorporation and Bylaws as such documents may be amended from time to time.
